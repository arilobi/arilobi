## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Marion Nabulobi!

I'm a software developer with a love of mixing my design skills with my coding skills. 
I aspire to be a FullStack Web developer where I can create an interactive and aesthetically pleasing UI that will catch a user's eye when they come across apps that I have developed or have received aid from fellow developers. 

**Fun Facts**

I started my passion for coding on freecodecamp.

I am a digital artist who specializes in drawing portraits and cute illustrations.

I love dancing. That is my form of cardio despite being 46 kgs!

I love cats and hope to adopt one when I get my first job!

I love creative writing and write stories part-time for fun. 

My favorite animation that gets me out of my sad days is Madagascar 3.

If I'm not coding, I am probably playing my favorite video game, **Infinity Nikki**
